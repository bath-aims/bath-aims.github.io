  title: Stochastic agent-based models in mathematical biology
  abstract: In the last decade, there has been a movement to describe biological and social systems via agent-based models, which track individual agents (organisms, cells, people) and their environment through a set of deterministic and probabilistic rules. In this talk, we examine how local individual-based mechanisms translate into global population dynamics. In particular, we will consider the Allee effect in population models, which were originally proposed to describe population dynamics that cannot be explained by exponential and logistic growth models. Using stochastic individual-based models, we can obtain a modelling framework that translates particular global Allee effects to specific individual-based mechanisms. This modelling framework is then extended to applications in the social sciences, including the modelling of sports riots and panic-buying.

  title: Graph-based learning and learned adversarial regularisation
  abstract: This talk is really two talks glued together under the (very!) vague theme of "learning". In the first half, I will give an overview of the field of graph-based learning, a field that has matured over the last 15 years and is rich in both practical applications and theoretical underpinnings. The key idea of graph-based learning is to understand interrelated data as a graph, to solve variational problems and PDEs on that graph to analyse that data, and to study the limits of such models as the number of nodes goes to infinity.  In the second half, I will talk about some of my recent work in learning a regulariser for inverse problems. In an inverse problem, one seeks to recover some unknown input given knowledge of some output measurement. This problem is ill-posed, as the measurement process invariably loses information. To counteract this, one must impose some prior for what the input "should" have looked like. Learned regularisation seeks to learn this prior from data.

  title: Polynomials for Fun and Profit
  abstract: This talk will outline a wide range of amazing properties of a few meek little polynomials. I will briefly discuss how I came to this line of inquiry honestly via the mathematics underlying the Dedalus computational framework for solving general classes of PDEs. But after that, I’m taking the gloves off for a wild trip through the land of geometry, probability and combinatorics.

  title: Water pressure evolution beneath glaciers
  abstract: In Antarctica and Greenland, most ice makes its way from the interior of the ice sheet, where it falls as snow, to the margins, where it ablates, via fast flowing glaciers. These glaciers flow fast due to sliding between the ice and bed, the rate of which sensitively depends on the water pressure there. In this talk I will present models for the subglacial hydrology of ice sheets which capture tidal and seasonal water pressure fluctuations, a range of timescales for which the overlying ice goes from behaving primarily elastically to viscously.

  title: Solving PDEs exactly over polynomials
  abstract: |
    Numerical simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs) are indispensable across science and engineering. For simple geometries, spectral methods are a powerful class of techniques that produce exceptionally accurate solutions for wide ranges of equations. But many variations of these methods exist, each with distinct properties and performance, and developing the best method for a complex nonlinear problem is often quite challenging.

    In this context, we present a framework that unifies all polynomial and trigonometric spectral methods, from classical "collocation" to the more recent "ultraspherical" schemes. In particular, we examine the exact discrete equations solved by each method and characterize their deviation from the original PDE in terms of perturbations called "tau corrections". By analyzing these corrections, we can precisely categorize existing methods and design new solvers that robustly accommodate new boundary conditions, eliminate spurious numerical modes, and satisfy exact conservation laws.

    This approach conceptually separates *what* discrete model a spectral scheme solves from *how* it solves it. This separation provides much more freedom when building and optimizing new numerical models. We will illustrate these advantages with various examples from fluid dynamics using Dedalus, an open-source package for solving PDEs with modern spectral methods.

  title: Lagrangian filtering for wave-mean flow decomposition
  abstract: In geophysical and astrophysical flows, we are often interested in understanding the impact of internal waves on the non-wavelike flow. For example, oceanic internal waves generated at the surface and the seafloor transfer energy from the large scale flow to dissipative scales, thereby influencing the global ocean state. A primary challenge in the study of wave-flow interactions is how to separate these processes – since waves and non-wavelike flows can vary on similar spatial and temporal scales in the Eulerian frame. However, in a Lagrangian flow-following frame, temporal filtering offers a convenient way to isolate waves. In this talk I’ll present and discuss some recently developed methods for evolving Lagrangian mean fields alongside the governing equations in a numerical simulation, allowing effective filtering of waves from non-wavelike processes.

  title: Global regularity for critical SQG in bounded domains
  abstract: |
    The critical SQG (surface quasi-geostrophic) equation is widely studied in relation to rapid formation of small scales in fluids. In the whole space or on the torus, this dissipative equation has been shown to have global smooth solutions some fifteen years ago by Caffarelli–Vasseur and, independently, by Kiselev–Nazarov–Volberg.

    The problem of existence and uniqueness of global smooth solution in bounded domains remained open until now. I will present a proof of global regularity obtained recently with Ignatova and Q-H. Nguyen. We introduce a new methodology of transforming the single nonlocal nonlinear evolution equation in a bounded domain into an interacting system of extended nonlocal nonlinear evolution equations in the whole space. The proof uses the method of the nonlinear maximum principle for nonlocal operators in the extended system.
