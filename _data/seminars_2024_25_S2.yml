  title: What can we learn about a dynamical system from data? – Impossibility results and classifications using adversarial dynamical systems.
  abstract: "Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for studying complex nonlinear systems using trajectory data, with applications spanning climate science, epidemiology, and beyond. A fundamental question arises: When can we reliably learn system behaviors from data, and when is it fundamentally impossible? In this talk, I will introduce the concept of adversarial dynamical systems-systems specifically designed to prevent learning algorithms from converging. This approach enables the development of a rigorous classification framework that identifies the intrinsic difficulty of problems and establishes what is fundamentally unattainable. These results reveal impossibility theorems for data-driven system learning, showing that such adversarial systems arise with high probability and that reliable learning can remain out of reach regardless of the algorithm, data quality, or quantity. To illustrate, I will focus on Koopman operators, which reformulate nonlinear dynamics as infinite-dimensional spectral problems (search “Koopmania” for more!). By understanding these barriers, we can design methods that provably converge, achieving breakthroughs such as state-of-the-art predictions of Arctic sea ice dynamics."

  title: Convergent viscous gravity driven flows as a model for mountain building
  abstract: "Many mountain ranges are formed when tectonic plates collide, resulting in the large-scale deformation of rock that produces topographic variations. Compression creates steep topographic gradients, whereas gravitational forces act to reduce contrasts in elevation, resulting in an evolving system that is governed by the balance of external forcing and gravity.  
 
Over sufficiently long timescales and lengthscales, this system can be modelled in a continuum manner, as a convergent viscous gravity current. In this talk I will discuss the progress we’ve made in modelling mountain building, from incorporating flexure of the underthrusting plate, to extending the rheology to yield stress fluids, both theoretically and numerically."

  title: Evolution of nonlinear waves in the marginal ice zone
  abstract: "Wave and sea ice properties in the Arctic and Southern Oceans are linked by feedback mechanisms, therefore the understanding of wave propagation in these regions is essential to model this key component of the Earth climate system. The most striking effect of sea ice in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) is the attenuation of waves at a rate proportional to their frequency. In this talk we will model their dynamics  by the damped nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS), its higher order version, Dysthe’s equation, or using the spatial Zakharov equation.  The evolution of energetic unidirectional random waves and the modulational instability will be discussed."

  title: The Dynamics of Stochastically-Forced Zonal Jets
  abstract: "Zonal jets are strong and persistent east-west flows that arise spontaneously in planetary atmospheres and oceans. They are ubiquitous, with key examples including mid-latitude jets in the troposphere, multiple jets in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and flows on gaseous giant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn. Turbulent flows on a beta-plane lead to the spontaneous formation and equilibration of persistent zonal jets. However, the equilibrated jets are not steady and the nature of the time variability in the equilibrated phase is of interest both because of its relevance to the behaviour of naturally occurring jet systems and for the insights it provides into the dynamical mechanisms operating in these systems. I will discuss aspects of zonal jet variability using insights from a framework of idealized, stochastically-forced models in which eddy-eddy interactions are systematically neglected."

  title: Coarse-grained models for schooling swimmers in fast flows
  abstract: "The beautiful displays exhibited by fish schools and bird flocks have long fascinated scientists, but the role of their complex behavior remains largely unknown. In particular, the influence of hydrodynamic interactions on schooling and flocking has been the subject of debate in the scientific literature. I will present a model for flapping wings that interact hydrodynamically in an inviscid fluid, wherein each wing is represented as a plate that executes a prescribed time-periodic kinematics. The model generalizes and extends thin-airfoil theory by assuming that the flapping amplitude is small, and permits consideration of multiple wings through the use of conformal maps and multiply-connected function theory. We find that the model predictions agree well with experimental data on freely-translating, flapping wings in a water tank. The results are then used to motivate a reduced-order model for the temporally nonlocal interactions between schooling wings, which consists of a system of nonlinear delay-differential equations. We obtain a PDE as the mean-field limit of these equations, which we find supports traveling wave solutions. Generally, our results indicate how hydrodynamics may mediate schooling and flocking behavior in biological contexts."

  title: Mathematical Modelling of the Evaporation of Sessile Droplets
  abstract: "The evaporation of a sessile droplet is a multifaceted problem of enduring scientific interest that is key to a wide range of everyday and industrial situations, such as protein crystallography, surface patterning, ink-jet printing, and agrochemical spraying of plants. In this talk I shall review some of the recent developments in the study of evaporating droplets, focusing on situations in which relatively simple mathematical models can give new insights into this fascinating multidisciplinary problem, including the competitive evaporation of multiple droplets, the evaporation of a droplet on a non-planar substrate, the effect of the spatial distribution of the local evaporative flux on the deposit left on the substrate by a particle-laden droplet, and the effect of gravity on the evaporation of a sessile droplet. The results presented in this talk are the outcomes of joint work with a large number of collaborators, including Drs Brian Duffy, David Pritchard and Alexander Wray (University of Strathclyde), Professor Khellil Sefiane (University of Edinburgh) and Professor Colin Bain (University of Durham), and past and present research students Gavin Dunn, Jutta Stauber, Feargus Schofield, Hannah-May D’Ambrosio, Laura Mills, David Craig and Henry Sharp, all of whose invaluable contributions are gratefully acknowledged."

  title: "Swimming in mud: modelling locomotion in cohesive materials"
  abstract: "Numerous natural and industrial materials, ranging from lava and mud to cosmetics, foodstuffs, blood and mucus, exhibit both fluid-like and solid-like behaviour: they can flow like a viscous fluid under sufficient force, but withstand deformation at lower stresses. Clogging and flow localisation in such materials is a generic feature of their mechanics: it underlies the triggering of mudslides, catastrophic liquefaction of mining waste, blood jamming in sickle cell disease, and numerous issues in industrial processing and cleaning. The problem of locomotion through such materials – encountered, for example, by worms moving through soil or sediment – is also controlled by these features of flow and stress localisation.
  
In this talk, I will explore some basic fluid mechanical behaviour of idealised viscoplastic materials, illustrating some ways in which channelling and clogging can generically occur. To further illustrate some of these features, I will particularly focus on the problem of undulatory ‘swimming’ through such materials, with the development of a viscoplastic slender-body theory and an explanation of how the rheology allows for a ‘burrowing’ mechanism of locomotion.

  title: "Turbulent zonal jets on giant planets: self-organization and wave-mean flow interactions"
  abstract: "The colourful bands of Jupiter are sustained by intense east-west winds called zonal jets, which extend well below Jupiter's weather layer into its mantle of liquid hydrogen. These jets constitute a fascinating natural example of how a rapidly-rotating turbulent flow self-organises at large scale. Despite decades of observations and modelling, understanding the long-term, nonlinear equilibration of zonal jets and the feedback with the underlying turbulence and waves is still a challenge. In this seminar, I will discuss the dynamics of zonal jets viewed from 1) a two-dimensional turbulence framework and 2) a quasilinear wave-mean flow interaction perspective. In both cases, I will use a combination of results from rapidly-rotating laboratory experiments, numerical models and theoretical analyses to highlight the essential role of Rossby waves in the emergence and nonlinear saturation of turbulent jets. These results aim to be generic and applicable to any fluid system exhibiting zonal jets, from oceans and atmospheres on Earth to liquid interiors of other planets and moons."

  title: "Nonlinear travelling waves in viscoelastic shear flows"
  abstract: "Viscoelastic fluids are common in industry and nature. They are characterised by a complex microstructure which gives rise to many counter-intuitive effects at the macroscale. This includes the creation of new types of self-sustaining `turbulent’ motion: (1) elastic turbulence which exists in the limit of zero Reynolds number and (2) elasto-inertial turbulence which relies on an interplay between inertia and elasticity, but has phenomenology which is distinct from the rolls and streaks of Newtonian turbulent boundary layers. The dynamical origins and connections between these regimes are the subject of ongoing experimental and computational study, and I will discuss our attempts to understand this subject via continuation of exact coherent structures (ECS) in parameter space. The ECS are finite amplitude solutions of the governing equations which are connected to new viscoelastic linear instabilities. An `arrowhead’ travelling wave (Page, Dubief & Kerswell, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2020) appears to be linked to the onset of chaotic motion at zero inertia in parallel channel (Lellep et al, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 2024), while finite amplitude solution associated with diffusivity in the polymer model can initiate transition to chaos over a wide range of Reynolds numbers (Beneitez et al, Pays. Rev. Fluids 2023). However, the latter appears to be incompatible with the continuum approximation and raises interesting questions about the underlying model for the polymers."

  title: "Using mathematical models to unravel cell-cell interactions and provide a link between genotype and phenotype."
  abstract: "In vitro cell biology assays are a cornerstone of biomedical science, from basic research that aims to provide fundamental new understanding of development, disease and repair, through to pharmaceutical applications that include drug discovery and cytotoxicity testing. A widely adopted strategy is to conduct a particular in vitro assay under a range of genetic perturbation conditions and observe how cellular phenotypes change. The key challenge is to then to determine the mechanisms by which the genetic perturbations give rise to the phenotypes. In this context, mathematical modelling has huge potential to overcome the challenges of elucidating mechanisms by providing a rigorous framework to describe the nonlinear interactions between cells and quantify the variations in system parameters following genetic perturbations. However, for models to be successful in teasing apart complex mechanisms from noisy, high-throughput data, we need to calibrate them to quantitative data. I will show how to calibrate a complicated model to data from a high-throughput scratch assay experiment across many gene knockdowns to characterise the relative contributions of local cell density-dependent and -independent mechanisms of cell movement and proliferation. I will show that it is possible characterise functional subgroups, and that density-dependent interactions play a crucial role in wound closure."

  title: "Phase change and convective localisation in reactive porous mushy layers"
  abstract: "This talk will consider mathematical and computational models of convective flow, pattern formation, and the asymptotic structure of so-called mushy layers, which are reactive porous materials formed by the solidifcation of binary alloys. The Arctic sea ice is a geophysically important example of such a mushy layer, comprising of ice crystals and salty brine which mixes via convection to drive salt fluxes to the underlying ocean. The internal structure of the mushy-layer evolves during sea ice growth, and we will explore the resulting impact on localisation of convective flows within the ice, including both the onset of convection and its nonlinear development."
