  title: Convection and phase change in environmental flows
  abstract: "Many processes in the climate system can be related to the coupling of fluid convection and thermodynamic phase changes, from ice-ocean interactions in polar regions to the formation and evolution of clouds in the atmosphere. In this talk, I will discuss some recent work aimed at understanding the fundamental interactions between convection and phase changes in simple systems. Firstly, motivated by the flows beside marine-terminating glaciers, I will describe the transition between buoyancy-driven and shear-driven boundary layers in turbulent mixed convection. Secondly, I will outline a newly-developed immersed boundary technique for simulating melting objects in turbulent flows, which reveals the subtle effects that the free motion of melting ice objects can introduce. Finally (time permitting), I will present some results from a system where phase changes drive the fluid motion - the simplified system of moist convection known as Rainy-BÃ©nard."
